netTransformer is a conceptual software prototype of a network transformation manager able to:

  -  Discover IP Networks
  -  Discover BGP peering Maps
  -  Capture its state
  -  Build a graph data model out of it
  -  Provide ability to review and reason about L2, L3, OSPF, ISIS and BGP topology
  -  Automate device configuration process through simplified template interface!
  -  Track the network evolution process
  -  Transform a network from one state to the other

netTransformer Version Pirin Edition builds on top of our previous work by adding postDiscoverers. Post Discoverers are able to
communicate through telnet or SSH with CISCO devices, to perform configuration management and to generate CISCO security audit reports.
