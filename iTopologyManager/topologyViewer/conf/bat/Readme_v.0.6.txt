netTransformer is a conceptual software prototype of a network transformation manager able to:

  -  Discover current network infrastructure

  -  Capture its state

  -  Build a graph data model out of it

  -  Provide ability to review and reason about L2, L3, OSPF, ISIS and BGP topology

  -  Automate device configuration process through simplified template interface!

  -  Track the network evolution process

  -  Transform a network from one state to the other

netTransformer Version 0.6 combines the best of our previous projects iTransformer and bgpPeeringMap.
