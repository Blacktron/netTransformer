netTransformer
==============
Welcome!

netTransformer is a software prototype able to:
*	Discover networks through various pluggable discoverers (SNMP, JSON, MRT)
*	Capture their state in a graph data model
*	Provide ability to engineers to review and reason about L2, L3, OSPF, ISIS, BGP or any other kind of a network topology
*	Automate device configuration process through simplified template interface
*	Track the network evolution process and create network DIFFs between any two network states

What we enjoy doing is generating beautifull dynamic network views from your networks
