iTransformer is simple but powerful open product for network transformation licensed under GPLv.3.

This is  release 0.2 of iTransformer. It's sole purpose is to fulfill the needs of some impatient users.
It is sufficient for:
- discovering IP networks through SNMP
- previewing and analysing the discovered network topology
- automate simple network activation activities through an simplified TELNET provisioning interface

Watch out for the next version. It will allow you to add new nodes/links into the network besides the discovered one.
Why this is needed - because in some cases the tool can't discover everything and we have to abe able to manually add
devices into the network. An example might be a device that does not support SNMP or a device that is passive or something else.
