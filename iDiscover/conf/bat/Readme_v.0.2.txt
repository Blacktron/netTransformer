iTransformer is simple but powerful open product for network transformation licensed under GPLv.3.

This is  release 0.2 of iTransformer. It's sole purpose is to fulfill the needs of some impatient users.
It is sufficient for:
- discovering IP networks through SNMP
- preview and analyse the discovered network topology
- automate network activation activities through an simplified TELNET/SNMP provisioning interface
- perform provisioning through a topological shortest path search

Watch out for the next version. It will allow you to add new nodes/links into the network besides the discovered one.
Why this is needed - in some cases the iDiscover can't reveal everything and we have to abe able to manually add
nodes and link into the network graph. An example might be a device that does not support SNMP or a device that is passive or something else.
