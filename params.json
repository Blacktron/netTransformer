{"name":"netTransformer","tagline":"netTransformer - Network Transformation Manager ","body":"### Welcome to the GitHub Page of netTransformer \r\nnetTransformer is a conceptual software prototype of a network transformation manager able to:\r\n\r\n- Discover current network infrastructure\r\n- Capture its state\r\n- Build a graph data model out of it\r\n- Provide ability to review and reason about L2, L3, OSPF, ISIS and BGP topology\r\n- Automate device configuration process through simplified template interface!\r\n- Track the network evolution process\r\n- Transform a network from one state to the other\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIn 2010, Nikolay Milovanov (@niau) and Vasil Yordanov (@vasil-yordanov) founded netTransformer.\r\nnetTransformer initially has been developed as part of the Phd of Nikolay in \"IPv4 to IPv6 network transformation\" and has been used for discovery and formalization in a data model of the current network state, modeling of the IPv4 to IPv6 network transformation strategy steps and their execution. Nikolay was also the person to develop most of the discovery methods and the integration with the network. Vasil always was the primary development force behind the project. To Vasil we also own most of the low level design, the split into multiple components and most of the code base.     \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with netTransformer?
